% The following is the skeleton code for the analysis stage of the WOLA method, which you need to
% complete


function [X,f] = WOLA_analysis_skeleton(x,fs,window,nfft,noverlap,g)
%WOLA_analysis  short-time fourier transform
% INPUT:
%   x           : input time signal(s) (samples x channels)
%   fs          : sampling rate
%   window      : window function
%   nfft        : FFT size
%   noverlap    : frame overlap; default: 2 (50%)
%   g           : filter(a vector with size (Lg*M)*1)
%
% OUTPUT:
%   X           : STFT matrix (bins x frames x channels)
%   f           : frequency vector for bins
